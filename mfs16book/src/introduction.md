# Introduction

The MFS-16 is a virtual computer, designed from scratch, with an original CPU instruction set and assembly language. The project attempts to be an accurate virtual representation of a theoretical computing system that could be implemented as real hardware.

The instruction set, assembly language, and general system architecture are entirely original, with particular inspiration taken from the [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080) and [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) instruction sets.

The MFS-16 code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/maxgmr/mfs16). The repository includes the core MFS-16 system, an assembler for assembling your own MFS-16 programs, and a desktop frontend with keyboard input, graphical display, user configuration, and a debugger.
